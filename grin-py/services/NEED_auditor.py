# This script should audit:
# 1) individual payouts - if there is a failure in the database or makePayouts.py script it should be detected and fixed here
# 2) overall pool payouts vs pool blocks found - if the pool pays out more than it has found in blocks an alarm should be raised
# 3) xxx add more
